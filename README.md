### Hi there 👋, I'm Tommy [he/him/his]

### 🛠 I’m currently working on ...

- resting (🛌 zzz)

### 📜 In the past I've worked at ...
- [Nuuly](https://www.nuuly.com/) as a Sr. Machine Learning Engineer.
  - During my first two years, I developed services, pipelines, and simulations to help with inventory management and logistics processing. These projects scaled from ~30k customers to ~350k customers, and saved (estimated) ~millions in shipping costs.
  - During my last couple of years at Nuuly I took ownership of our recommendation system. Working with two other data scientists, we built a transformer-based recommendation model that improved offline recall and precision by ~50% for active subscribers, and gave us dramatic improvement for "stale" customers (who haven't rented in >2 months).
- U.S. Census Bureau as a [Software Engineering Civic Digital Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship/) developing a content-first API for educational material created @ the USCB
- [Sharing Excess](https://sharingexcess.web.app/) to help reduce food waste from grocery stores and restaurants
- [Rise First](https://risefirst.org/) as a web developer building out content pages for their website
- Vanguard (Contracted) as an IT Developer intern where I helped automate middle-office processes using Python and Java
- [SASE Drexel](https://sase-drexel.weebly.com/) as webmaster helping to maintain their [websites](https://sase-drexel.github.io/mentorship-profiles/)
- [Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/) as an undergrad researcher
- [Code for Chicago](https://codeforchicago.org/) and [Code for Philly](https://codeforchicago.org/) making small contributions to front-end projects
